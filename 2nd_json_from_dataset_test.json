        "Hey Italy! What's your plan for the game?",
        "Bongiorno!  To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women!  I mean, umm, not really sure yet.  Pondering whether or not to make an early play around Munich",
        "I'd personally rather you didn't, because a play around Munich is also a play around Trieste and Vienna. I've heard that there's some rancor over in the West and you might be able to profit from a mobbed France if you went that way.",
        "Good to know, thanks!",
        "Well, that went well! Shall we push on with the ways we started?",
        "Well, the West and East are both an unholy mess now.  Second fleet incoming, I assume you agree we need to nip that Turkish issue in the bud before it becomes unmanageable?",
        "So...was that a no?",
        "Indeed.",
        "Peccato.  I was really hoping we could bring order (or at least mutual profit) out of the chaos.",
        "Sorry we couldn't patch things up."
